Web application security is a branch of information security that deals specifically with security of websites, web applications and web services.

## Common Vulnerabilities

### OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security:

1. **Injection** - SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection
2. **Broken Authentication** - Authentication and session management issues
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Inadequate protection of sensitive data
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - XML processors vulnerabilities
5. **Broken Access Control** - Authorization bypass vulnerabilities
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - Insecure default configurations
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - XSS flaws
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - Unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities** - Vulnerable dependencies
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** - Inadequate logging and monitoring

## Security Testing

### Static Analysis

Static analysis tools examine source code without executing it:

- **Code review** - Manual examination of source code
- **SAST tools** - Automated static application security testing
- **Dependency scanning** - Checking for vulnerable dependencies

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis tests running applications:

- **DAST tools** - Dynamic application security testing
- **Penetration testing** - Manual security assessment
- **Fuzzing** - Automated input testing

## Defense Strategies

### Input Validation

All input should be validated:

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    const re = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return re.test(email);
}
```

### Output Encoding

Encode data when outputting to prevent XSS:

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div>Hello {{username}}</div>

<!-- Good -->
<div>Hello {{username | escape}}</div>
```

### Authentication

Implement strong authentication:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Strong password policies
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Session management

### Authorization

Proper access control:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## Security Headers

Important HTTP security headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events

Log security-relevant events:

- Authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Input validation failures
- System errors
- Administrative actions

### Monitoring Tools

Use appropriate monitoring tools:

- **SIEM systems** - Security Information and Event Management
- **Log aggregation** - Centralized logging systems
- **Alerting systems** - Real-time threat detection
- **Incident response** - Automated response systems

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards

- **ISO 27001** - Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk-based approach
- **PCI DSS** - Payment card industry standards
- **SOX** - Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance

### Regulations

- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation
- **HIPAA** - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **CCPA** - California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOX** - Sarbanes-Oxley Act
