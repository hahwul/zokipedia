# What is Lorem ipsum?

Lorem ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text widely used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its main purpose is to allow page layouts to be designed independently before actual content is filled in, or to demonstrate various fonts without meaningful text that could distract from design elements.

## History and Origin

Lorem ipsum is generally based on parts of "De finibus bonorum et malorum," a 1st-century BC work by the Roman statesman and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero. The text has been altered by changing, adding, and removing words to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words, "Lorem ipsum," are a truncation of "dolorem ipsum" ("pain itself").

The use of this text began in the 1960s and gained popularity through advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. In the mid-1980s, Aldus Corporation introduced it to the digital world by incorporating it into templates for their desktop publishing program, PageMaker. Since then, it has been adopted by popular word processors like Apple's Pages and Microsoft Word, web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries like Semantic UI.

## Example Text

A common example of Lorem ipsum text is as follows:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
